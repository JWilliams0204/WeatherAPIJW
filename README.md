# WeatherAPIJW
I was only able to get the local storage of my website working. So when you go to search for city open the console and you will see the information there. I also creted an HTML with HTML elemets and connections to my javascript, jquery, and bootstrap.

Edit: I was able to get the weather api website to work. I used function searchWeather where i created global variables apikey, and queryURL. I used the ajax method to call the api url. I also created html tags by using jquery
