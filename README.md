# WeatherAPIJW
I created my weather app, using Jquery, bootstrap, javascript and HTML. In the javascript i created the searchWeather function which uses ajax to call the openweathermap API. The .ajax function uses the variable cityName to call forth all the information received by searched a specific city. I use jquery to create an <h2> HTML element that displays the city searched name. I also used jquery to display the wind speed, and humidity in the city. I created a function that converted kelvin into fahrenheit, called convertKelvinToF. My local storage was created in afunction called savetoStorage, and used JSON to stringify the current city data. I finally created the function called showButtons which allows the information form the local storage of the past cities saved. To be displayed on the oage in button form, after you refresh the page.
